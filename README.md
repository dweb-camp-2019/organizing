>How do we build a better Web? The Web we want, the Web we deserve? A Web with no central points of control?

Since 2016, weâ€™ve been calling this the _Decentralized Web_ (DWeb for short) and now the Internet Archive is inviting everyone who wants to imagine and co-create that better Web to join us this summer at one of the most beautiful spots on Earth.

This is the repository for the organizing of **DWeb Camp** from **July 18-21, 2019**. Please see our [event announcement on the Internet Archive blog](https://blog.archive.org/2019/03/24/coming-this-summer-the-first-dweb-camp/) for details.
