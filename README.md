=========================

>How do we build a better Web? The Web we want, the Web we deserve? A Web with no central points of control?

Since 2016, weâ€™ve been calling this the _Decentralized Web_ (DWeb for short) and now the Internet Archive is inviting everyone who wants to imagine and co-create that better Web to join us this summer at one of the most beautiful spots on Earth.

This is the repository for the organizing of **DWeb Camp** from **July 18-21, 2019**.
Please see our [event announcement](https://blog.archive.org/2019/03/24/coming-this-summer-the-first-dweb-camp/) and  [hacking possibilities](https://blog.archive.org/2019/05/26/spark-new-ideas-technologies-at-dweb-camp-2019/) on the Internet Archive blog.

## Get There

See the [DWeb Camp website](https://dwebcamp.org) for event and registration details. This event has a [Code of Conduct](https://dwebcamp.org/conduct/).

After you have registered, here are some handy pages for coordinating logistics:

- [Rideshare page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WjZd33F5no2AQ8BAbMDMoQMv8eFAsp8-SNNR3Z_M-Zc/edit?ts=5cfff040#gid=676404853) for people looking to offer/need rides to and from Camp. If you have 3 people in your car, parking is free. Look for the tabs at the bottom for each day.

  If you'd be interested in paying for a bus that picks up at Oakland BART and the Internet Archive (300 Funston Ave, SF) and takes you to Camp and back.  The roundtrip fare is approximately $50.

- [Stay at Internet Archive](https://github.com/dweb-camp-2019/organizing/issues/73/) on `Wednesday, July 17` (the day before Camp) and `Sunday, July 21` (the night after Camp), fill out this [form](https://fs26.formsite.com/ArchiveHR/IA_sleepover_2019/index.html).

## Open Dialogue Calls

These are one hour-long public video calls for you to ask us logistical questions, bounce your project ideas off of us (and each other!), and maybe even find other collaborators to work on a project.
