Kick-off Week Summary
=====================

The first week of April was DWeb Camp kick-off week for organizers, starting off with a visit to _The Farm_ from March 31 - April 1, followed by a week of meetings at the Internet Archive from April 3 - 5.
Eight of us arrived to The Farm on a beautiful day, most of us visiting for the first time, and got a tour around the site where DWeb Camp 2019 will be held.

The coastal camp site was really beautiful and there were lots of interesting projects going on, from agriculture to energy projects, which may end up powering much of DWeb Camp.

We spent about half an hour walking around, discovering many areas connected by walking paths.
Immediately we started imagining the possibilities for this huge patch of lawn surrounded by giant structures and a junkyard full of different materials.

There were also facilities such as the Tea Lounge and a couple other large indoor spaces.

Three of us decided to stay in one of the tents, which will be available for rent at DWeb Camp.
They can comfortably fit 4 people with plenty of extra space.
The campgrounds would be scattered throughout the site, which presents a challenge to distribute news across the entire event space, but also makes for an exciting opportunity for groups to connect themselves to the local meshnet using wireless radios.

We discussed processes for information distribution, favouring low-tech processes in case our digital tools break down.
For example, a teams of volunteers going around to write schedule updates on large blackboards!
Or other offline processes like USB dead drops loaded with pre-built binaries of peer-to-peer tools, a peer-to-peer human process commonly used in places with limited Internet access.

Our group, along with many people at The Farm, spent a lot of time talking about learnings from previous event organizings from [Burning Man](https://burningman.org) to [ScuttleCamp](https://one.camp.scuttlebutt.nz), logistical things like space use and power distribution, and most importantly the culture of the place and the common visions that DWeb Camp shares.

After spending lots of time with the friendly staff at The Farm, sharing stories around the bonfire after delicious meals prepared by our hospitable hosts, we were inspired to imagine a DWeb Camp that not only connects people and applications, but also to nature and our shared roots.
Having the privilege to hold DWeb Camp on such beautiful natural land, it's an excellent opportunity to start from our shared roots, with the basics we need to survive, make inclusive spaces to connect with one another to explore the role of technology and the purpose of decentralization. How, for whom, and on what soil, do we build our Decentralized Web?
