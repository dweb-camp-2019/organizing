- mikey
- nico (briefly in the beginning)

## Goals of DWeb Camp

- we have to support a 3rd path for technologists who want to improve the web / society
- how about something like a camp (ccc), values centric
- we felt the first 2016 dweb conference felt like it made a start but the community was still fractured

- In 2018 technology alone was not going to save us, need to get people...
It was a more diverse group.
man of the things scuttlcamp did, scholarshps, 50%+ color and gender diversity
this year we a we are trying ...
connect mind with...
 we a we a we a we a we a

- mind
- community
- planet

- > What do you mean by transformative?
    - Personally
    - Wendy: current web is failing us
    - Applicable in real world
    - Ben: Decentralized web building is also partly failing us
    - Need more perspectives
    - Wendy: Challenge people's perspectives

- nicop: myconnection is not working for me to follow you. have a nice meeting, will read you later! thanks ben from bringing my concerns up :)

- ben: how do we make meaningful involvement from the people involved
    - not easy for someone from an indigenous village to fly out to a camp in the US, expensive etc
    - all talents are valuable, learnings are bi-directional, not hiearchical

- mix: question, have you put out an ask for funding for diversity / inclusion?
    - wendy: are putting calls out, relationship with Ford foundation, maybe too late to bring people who need visas, but can bring over the people who work with those people
    - mix: request: publish a post about the work you're doing and have a clear ask
        - for ScuttleCamp, once we put out that we were trying to support diversity, more people came forward with support
            - "if you ask, people will see what you're doing and value it, give up their silly money to your cause"
- > question co-creation?
- In 2018, we got money from Ford, and they designated people, but not everyone was super excited to come
- Mix: don't like organization hand-picking people
- Ben: we went through the list of attendees from last year, then added people we wanted to include, will pair down this list to ~150
    - but what is this list for? maybe we help those who need financial help, for example if 50 of the 150 needed help, we could bring the list to funders who could help
    - Mix: i'm not sure people need to read a list of names, people just want to support
    - Ben: what is the message we say, how do people know they aren't throwing their money away?
    - Start with not very granular (e.g. here is what we did on diversity so far, but this is what our dream is and we need this goal)
        - can publish updates as the situation progresses, it's an on-going conversation
- Wendy: some nuances, some people want financial support but could actually pay for themselves, lawyers etc
    - Mix: so just say no?
    - Wendy: but some people were valuable for us to come. we didn't have a scholarship committee last year, but Gunner suggested we should
- Wendy: Two best things that happened at ScuttleCamp?

## Walkthrough of The Format of ScuttleCamp

-  Formatted on Enspiral Retreats
-  2 days of "body of camp" full days = 2 days transit
-  first day: Sit in one room, one circle (Alot of format is about sitting in circles, listening)
-  NOTE: had to enforce arriving by a certain time on Day One
-  Only a couple of group facilitated things:  Group Timeline (The story so far; how do we get everyone aligned with context;)
-  2/4/8 format (what is this?)
-  How do we get everyone aligned on why we are gathered here right now
-  BULK OF TIME:  Open Space; divide up into slots of time and space
-  No pre-decided speakers; more about dialogue
-  First night: Lightning talks** (have sign up in advance; 5min each)
-  Started with role models who we knew could do 5:00 talks as examples****
-  3 Organizers (Mix, Mikey, Alanna)+ 8 people as leaders of the Fairy Rings (8 groups) who could shepherd
-  Fairy Rings:  Home nests; Home Groups; distributed leaders in each group; check in before dinner
-  "Hey how is it going? How is the conference going for you" opportunity for people to be more vulnerable
-  If you don't put conscious structures for support, people will do that invisibly; by actively structuring for that, you prevent burn-out
-  Think: what are the different formats of grouping that we can encourage
-  HIGHLY recommend unstructured time; Nap! Hike! Recharge!
-  2 Full days:  Mostly open space in hour-long slots; 
-  Tuesday: group facilitation of "Utopia/future vision"
-  Tuesday evening:  Story circle led by Alanna; creating a space in lounge, make it feel like a different place; change lighting
-  Prompt Question: "What brings you joy?" eg--talk about concrete things
-  Story circle: you could only enter and leave between stories; 
-  WHAT IF THIS WASN'T YOUR JAM? akward for those who left; so set up an alternative space--board game area;  
-  Wendy: Unscheduled time (nothing happens except walking to the beach, take a nap), Mix and Mikey highly recommends having this

- Ben: Before and After the Camp? How did people connect to plan what to do at Camp? After the event is there continuity of projects?
- What to expect:  Mikey wrote a blog about Open Space to explain how that works
- During event, Sam wrote a post--it would be great to document these occurences, and a lot of people came forward
- MOZFEST: propose before and Pop-up both
- SSB Camp: mostly about relationships; creating new relationships; less about coming to some technical decision
- Relationships are the fertile soil in which growth can happen;
- The entire community is on SSB, so there is a place to continue the conversations
- WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY?
    - MIX: I wish I had articulated this "just hang out; this is not to make technical progress. It's about making relationships"
    - Take opportunity to build trust, not a slide deck or come to some consensus on technical decisions
    - Wish we had MORE unstructured time; I realized we needed **explicitly unstructured time**; off-grid synthesizers-- 2 hours per day was not enough
    - great to have one whole day that is unstructured; more like a festival where we hang out & have conversations
    - wish difficult conversations started earlier: Decolonizing the Web; wish that could have happened earlier; maybe you needed to build trust first
    - one interesting and complex session happened on the last day, didn't have enough opportunity to unpack
- Mix: Leave space for ad-hoc organized stuff
- HOW DO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON?  Open Space Board; Here's what's happening today; be super careful--maybe a giant piece of paper is the best
- Duplicate on SSB--but that is secondary
- How Did you Ensure Inclusion?  Lots of conversations beforehand; listening and adapting to people's needs; got the sense that organizers cared ab out them alot
- Home Groups helped; Free time was key; during freetime people found their tribe and made connections
- Some sessions were run by diverse facilitators--having a support person/host in addition to the facilitator was helpful
- Pairing hosts and facilitators (so it doesn't need to be the host that tells audience how to behave)
- NEW FRONTIERS Camp -- for every Open Space there was a trained facilitator to go along with the host of the space

- Wednesday Night: Party--board games; dancing; cocktails; music; opening act: good DJ (open mic for musicians)
- Mix: Would like to come, but needs to figure out work situation; Happy to reflect on ideas & attend calls like this one
- Mikey: coming, happy to help in small ways or perhaps more
- MULTI-DIMENSIONAL PROJECTS: don't use word "conference;" Festival, retreat, camp, 
- "Follow your hearts:" if you go and it's not what you thought, follow your feet; no expectations; I wish we had added: think about how much challenge you can take on
- How far out of your comfort zone are you willing to go?  EG-- go to a session about harrassment and abuse and you haven't thought about that; what could tranformation look like?
- Skeptical about having enough time to do an elaborate project; you wouldn't want to hang out with the same group all day long
- Collaboration Cafe:  Great format--start with lightning talk; 4 people bringing a problem:  How do I tell the story of SSB? I'm looking for funding and don't know if our business model works yet.  Then there's a facilitated process to help them, workshopping the person's problem; swarm on the problem; challenge them; goal is not to solve the problem-- it's to help them get to answers. People rotate. Low commitment;
- Signing up to engage in an open space
  - world cafe / collaboration cafe

## Questions to Revisit

- Co-creation
  - yes, and what structures do we put in place to guide the co-creation to be more transformative/ challenging (and not just more dominant culture)
  - e.g. how can you make sure there are formats which will make space for more marginalisted people to have leadership + power 
- Given the size of the Camp is 500 ppl what do you think is a max Fairy Ring size to be effective?
- Do you have things that you feel we should think about, because of the 500 ppl size?
