DWeb Camp 2019 // Open Dialogue Call // July 3
==============================================

**These notes will be published publicly**

DWeb Camp [Open Dialogue calls](https://github.com/dweb-camp-2019/organizing#open-dialogue-calls) are a space for you to ask us logistical questions, bounce your project ideas off of us (and each other!), and maybe even find other collaborators to work on a project.

## Participants

- Mai, she/they, People's Open
- Zelf, she/her, SSB: grant writing. Interested in decentralization, alternative spaces to the internet, particularly facebook, part of school called Chaos Pirates (alternative enterprise leadership school). 
    - Excited about DWeb because Zelf will be sponsored by ___ Writers, a lobbying group in the EU to promote radical ideas in the EU. They will help set up a podcast, which will be touring through other camps
    - She will be interviewing people at DWe - wants suggestions about who to interview
- Angelica, she/they, Beaker browser: loves making websites on the DWeb
    - Excited to talk about decentralization that is not focused on blockchain based tech, that there are other themes where things can be talked about, especially supportive spaces for artists
- dcrocker (Dave Crocker). Internet user-level tech pre-Internet.
- Dinesh, Janastu in India, working on social issues for 20 years, was in Silicon Valley before that as an engineer, community radio, how low-literacy people can join the web when they cannot read or write — 5B people. Make sure repositories are decentralized, how this can be a way to connect those unconnected


## Notes
- How we talk about the blockchain
    - Some of us being tired of fixation of blockchain, however, it was also a starting point for many of us to re-think value, digital networks, decentralization of the web
    - We should talk about how it's not the only thing we talk about when we talk about decentralization
        - (dcrocker) When a discussion tends towards technical microdetails too soon, I tend to suggest instead talking about goals and functionality without allowing any reference to technology or acronyms.  If people can agree in non-technical terms about what problem they are trying to solve or feature they are trying to provide and what it's basic operational characteristics need to be, then diving into technical details, such as distributed ledger versus tightly regulated central server, versus whatever, things go much better.
    - Zelf entered space from political activism, jumped straight into SSB. She has avoided anything that is related to capitalism. Reacts strongly to decentralized projects that is still tokenization, putting points on this — whether it's social, value, etc.
- Decolonization of technology
    - How structure is communication > how those who set the structure shape communication > How it can recreate colonialist stucture
    - Once you deconstruct this, you start deconstructing the fabric of society
- Interviews w/ Zenna: Can be added to schedule so we people can watch as it's happening
- Schedule: decentralized leadership
