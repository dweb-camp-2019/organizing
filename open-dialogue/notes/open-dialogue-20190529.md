**These notes will be published publicly**

DWeb Camp [Open Dialogue calls](https://github.com/dweb-camp-2019/organizing#open-dialogue-calls) are a space for you to ask us logistical questions, bounce your project ideas off of us (and each other!), and maybe even find other collaborators to work on a project.

    - Robert: still in planning phase of trip logistics; Learning lots of different things:
        - how this kind of thing is run
        - getting hands on P-2-P tech
        - Playing and creating with tech
    - Xiaowei: having interactive abilities; central room; community focused; low stakes where you could just ask people questions; 
        - There will be a lot of opportunities to get creative, more low stakes environment where you can ask anything
    - Ben: build trust; extending into network of events
    - Kelsey: NODE-JS camp; a lot of unstructured time; juggling balls; drone; slack lineJ

        - [Decentralized principles and protocol politics](https://github.com/dweb-camp-2019/projects/issues/5)
- Ben: How do we keep people in the Open Source ecosystem?
    - Using, maintaining, practicing, and livelihood from open source
- Jess:
    - meeting people
    - discovering what people are making
    - hosting discussions about Decentralized business models
    - finding out who is working on different business models
    - hands on tech--go build Dapps
- Wendy:
    - VALUE FLOW & HANDSHAKE are bringing new economic models
    - Mix Irving is bringing knowledge from the Coop Enspiral

- Q: What are you most worried about?
- Alex:
    - simple, silly things that can go wrong
    - Burning Man runs pretty well, but individually camps within it don't always run so well
    - Not just the technical aspects of having a "dweb", but people need to know how to use it (it's not something most of us have much experience with as users)
- [valueflo.ws](https://github.com/dweb-camp-2019/projects/issues/16#issuecomment-496058732) by pospi
- [Technical Salon](https://github.com/dweb-camp-2019/projects/issues/21) for meeting people
- Mai:  how to connect the dots between disparate workshops
- Xiaowei: 
    - once all the projects flopped b/c of power/internet; even that was okay
    - power structures that camp is trying to go up against, is reproduced
    - certain people can get stuck with the "care" labor; that happens in business as well
    - how to make sure equity in power structures can be upheld
- Mai: is there a way to be reflective of what is going on? An anonymous way to post?
    - real time feedback within the Camp itself
    - instead of sub-tweeting, can we be more transparent and open about what goes on
- Kelsey: biggest fear--failure to connect
    - if you have a quorum from one company, they only talk to each other
    - Mixer events, even hokey ones, would be good
    - preparing and cleaning up from a meal can be a good way to connect
    - Trained facilitators to help people talk (1/n rule)
- Q: What do you think about having "small Groups"--led by conversation facilitators
    - Rules: not Yes, but....Yes, and
    - 1/N rule
    - rules of respect
    - stand in a circle but leave one space empty, so others can join
- Kelsey's Technical Salon Project! a great place to implement some of these rules^
- Alex: How do we weave things together?
    - Ways participants can feel concepts distributed themselves
    - self organize in small groups
    - social protocols
    - what a threat is?
    - leadership-- group dynamics of electing your own leaders
- Kelsey:
    - When people go to Burning Man they don't think about what they get, they think about what they bring
- Q What will you bring to share?
    - slack line
    - Circus tools: juggling 
    - soccer ball
    - frisbee
    - face and body paints
    - good cocktails
    - mesh related tech: 2 radios that are already configured--IP + Walkie Talkie called Wireless Wire;
    - Raspberry Pis
    - Test Net with laptops
- Q: What kind of Internet Connection is there?
    - high bandwidth local network with 100s of Mbps, without connection to internet
    - Also two towers--bringing 300 MBPS into farm in traditional internet
- Q: What kind of consent do we need to record people? Interview people? Film people?
    - This is a great question for Code of Conduct team
